  abstract = {We present a method for jointly learning dynamic models of transcriptional

	Bayesian network inference algorithms; joint learning is accomplished
	by incorporating evidence from gene expression data through the likelihood,
	and from transcription factor binding location data through the prior.
	We propose a new informative structure prior with two advantages.
	First, the prior incorporates evidence from location data probabilistically,
	allowing it to be weighed against evidence from expression data.
	Second, the prior takes on a factorable form that is computationally
	efficient when learning dynamic regulatory networks. Results obtained
	from both simulated and experimental data from the yeast cell cycle
	demonstrate that this joint learning algorithm can recover dynamic
	regulatory networks from multiple types of data that are more accurate
	than those recovered from each type of data in isolation.},

  pages = {RESEARCH0059},
  number = {11},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Organisms simplify the orchestration of gene expression
	by coregulating genes whose products function together in the cell.
	Many proteins serve different roles depending on the demands of the
	organism, and therefore the corresponding genes are often coexpressed
	with different groups of genes under different situations. This poses
	a challenge in analyzing whole-genome expression data, because many
	genes will be similarly expressed to multiple, distinct groups of
	genes. Because most commonly used analytical methods cannot appropriately
	represent these relationships, the connections between conditionally
	coregulated genes are often missed. RESULTS: We used a heuristically
	modified version of fuzzy k-means clustering to identify overlapping
	clusters of yeast genes based on published gene-expression data following
	the response of yeast cells to environmental changes. We have validated
	the method by identifying groups of functionally related and coregulated
	genes, and in the process we have uncovered new correlations between
	yeast genes and between the experimental conditions based on similarities
	in gene-expression patterns. To investigate the regulation of gene
	expression, we correlated the clusters with known transcription factor
	binding sites present in the genes' promoters. These results give
	insights into the mechanism of the regulation of gene expression
	in yeast cells responding to environmental changes. CONCLUSIONS:
	Fuzzy k-means clustering is a useful analytical tool for extracting
	biological insights from gene-expression data. Our analysis presented
	here suggests that a prevalent theme in the regulation of yeast gene
	expression is the condition-specific coregulation of overlapping
	sets of genes.},

	additional types of information, such as clinical data or known attributes

	a single coherent probabilistic model, that encompasses much of the
	rich structure in the genomic expression data, while incorporating
	additional information such as experiment type, putative binding
	sites, or functional information. We show how this model can be learned

	between the gene expression patterns and additional attributes. The
	learned model reveals context-specific relationships, that exist
	only over a subset of the experiments in the dataset. We demonstrate
	the power of our approach on synthetic data and on two real-world
	gene expression data sets for yeast. For example, we demonstrate

	at inferring nonlinear neural information flow networks from electrophysiology

	of the system, and reveal both the importance of reciprocal feedback
	in auditory processing and greater information flow to higher-order
	auditory areas when birds hear natural as opposed to synthetic sounds.
	A linear method applied to the same data incorrectly produces networks
	with information flow to non-neural tissue and over paths known not
	to exist. To our knowledge, this study represents the first biologically

	based on the structure of the estimated network, then re-estimates
	the network using the result of the motif detection. We continue

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The question addressed here is how cooperative interactions
	among transcription factors (TFs), a very frequent phenomenon in
	eukaryotic transcriptional regulation, can be used to identify genes
	that are regulated by one or more TFs with known DNA binding specificities.
	Cooperativity may be homotypic, involving binding of only one transcription
	factor to multiple sites in a gene's regulatory region. It may also
	be heterotypic, involving binding of more than one TF. Both types
	of cooperativity have in common that the binding sites for the respective
	TFs form tightly linked 'clusters', groups of binding sites often
	more closely associated than expected by chance alone. RESULTS: A
	statistical technique suitable for the identification of statistically
	significant homotypic or heterotypic TF binding site clusters in
	whole eukaryotic genomes is presented. It can be used to identify
	genes likely to be regulated by the TFs. Application of the technique
	is illustrated with two transcription factors involved in the cell
	cycle and mating control of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating
	that the results obtained are biologically meaningful. This rapid
	and inexpensive computational method of generating hypotheses about
	gene regulation thus generates information that may be used to guide
	subsequent costly and laborious experimental approaches, and that
	may aid in the assignment of biological functions to putative open
	reading frames.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is among the
	mainstream approaches for modeling various biological networks, including
	the gene regulatory network (GRN). Most current methods for learning
	DBN employ either local search such as hill-climbing, or a meta stochastic
	global optimization framework such as genetic algorithm or simulated
	annealing, which are only able to locate sub-optimal solutions. Further,
	current DBN applications have essentially been limited to small sized
	networks. RESULTS: To overcome the above difficulties, we introduce
	here a deterministic global optimization based DBN approach for reverse
	engineering genetic networks from time course gene expression data.
	For such DBN models that consist only of inter time slice arcs, we
	show that there exists a polynomial time algorithm for learning the
	globally optimal network structure. The proposed approach, named
	GlobalMIT+, employs the recently proposed information theoretic scoring
	metric named mutual information test (MIT). GlobalMIT+ is able to
	learn high-order time delayed genetic interactions, which are common
	to most biological systems. Evaluation of the approach using both
	synthetic and real data sets, including a 733 cyanobacterial gene
	expression data set, shows significantly improved performance over
	other techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that deterministic
	global optimization approaches can infer large scale genetic networks.},

	developed a TF-centric clustering (TFCC) algorithm that may provide
	such missing information through incorporation of biological knowledge
	about TFs. TFCC is a semi-supervised clustering algorithm which relies
	on the assumption that the expression profiles of some TFs may be
	related to those of the genes under their control. We examined this
	premise and found the vicinities of TFs in expression space are often
	enriched with the genes they regulate. So, instead of clustering
	genes based on the mutual similarity of their expression profiles
	to each other, we used TFs as seeds to group together genes whose
	expression patterns correlate with that of a particular TF. Then
	a Gibbs sampling algorithm was applied to search for shared cis-regulatory
	elements in promoters of clustered genes. Our working hypothesis
	was that if a TF-centric cluster indeed contains many targets of
	the seeding TF, at least one of the discovered motifs would be the
	site bound by the very same TF. We tested the TFCC approach on eight
	cell cycle and sporulation regulating TFs whose binding sites have
	been previously characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and correctly
	identified binding site motifs for half of them. In addition, we
	also made de novo predictions for some unknown TF binding sites.},
